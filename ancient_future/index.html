        <p>Pictotype is a book made up of Wikipedia pages for my class project ‘Wikibook’. We were tasked to take a topic of interest and create a book in Indesign utilizing the technical skills we learned such as kerning, line spacing, and rag in order to make a cohesive and dynamic book.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Pictotype talks about Type Design, Logograms, The Rebus Principal, and Egyptian Hieroglyphics all in an effort to explore how symbols have been a basis of communication since the beginning of time. </p>
        <br>
        <p>The cover and various symbols throughout each chapter are created solely using the letter ‘t’. This is my exploration of deconstructing the rigid role that letters are given. Seeing letter and type design as art rather than pure function.</p>
